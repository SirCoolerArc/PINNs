In this week, I'm learning PyTorch from CampusX playlist whose code implementation is shown in the "CampusX" jupyter file. <br>
I have also watched some additional videos on PINNs sent by my mentor & developed a basic understanding of the their working principles. <br>
I intend to cover the TensorFlow part from the Daniel Bourke YT video. <br>
Also, I aim to read through the research papers provided by my mentor regarding PINNs.
