# PINNs: SoC project 2025 <br>
Author: Rishabh Kumar <br>
In this project, I started by learning basic Python from CodeWithHarry playlist which is included in the "BasicPython" code file. <br>
After that, I proceeded to learn some python libraries: NumPy, Pandas & matplotlib via the resources provided by my mentor. Although, all of the implementation code might not be present, I have skimmed through it all. <br>
Then, I read the "Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie​ł​a Neural Networks from Scratch" book. I have written code implementation in the "NNFS" code file. Though, all of the code might not be present, but I have completed up to chapter 10 from that book with a thorough understanding. <br>
To further strengthen my understanding of backpropagation, I watched some additional yt video by myself. <br>
Now, I'm learning PyTorch from CampusX playlist. <br>
I have also watched some additional videos on PINNs sent by my mentor & developed a basic understanding of the their working.
