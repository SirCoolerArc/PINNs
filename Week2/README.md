In this week, I read the "Neural Networks from Scratch" book by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie​ł​a. <br>
I have written the code implementation in the "NNFS" jupyter file. <br>
Though, all of the code might not be present, <br>
but I have completed up to chapter 10 from that book with a thorough understanding. <br>
To further strengthen my understanding of backpropagation, I watched some additional yt video by myself. <br>
The other code files in this week apart from NNFS jupyter file is made purely for experimentation purposes.
